To run the projects, you need to have the necessary dependencies installed, which are listed in the specified locations:
./Marek.szteleblak/client/clientDependencies.txt
./Marek.szteleblak/server/serverDependencies.txt


Next, you need to start the servers, making sure to be in the appropriate folder.
./Marek.szteleblak/client/ and ./Marek.szteleblak/server/.

You need to use the commands "npm install" and "npm start" in both projects.
Make sure that the ports on which the server runs, 5000 and 3000, are free.
The website will open at the address: localhost:3000.
Remember that you need Node.js and MongoDB for it to work.
MongoDB should be running on port 27017.
Node.js must have a version above 14.00.
